## Education

I went to the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](https://www.unomaha.edu/) and majored in music performance, but I eventually [dropped out](https://youtu.be/mZ7xypQy_Ks) due to conflict with work at the time.

In general, I do not think that people need to have a college degree in order to have good opinions or to know what they are talking about; so long as we're working in the same epistemic framework based on [evidence](https://scholar.google.com) and [rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/). I used to think that most college programs instilled this, but, over the past several years of debate and conversation, my respect for college-educated individuals has [significantly](https://youtu.be/x-hfTVPakVg) [dropped](https://youtu.be/JcA5szcnESY). That being said, a formal education certainly doesn't hurt. Overall, most laymen should defer to the consensus of experts in the realm of descriptive facts. A good example of this can be found in [my discussion with Vegan Gains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yK-lO98scI).

## Family

I have a son, Nathaniel, with my ex-girlfriend, Rachel. Her and I broke up a long time ago because we had an incredibly toxic relationship, but we are on very good terms now and have a healthy coparenting relationship. I have an ex-wife as well, but she is not the mother of my child.

## Relationship

[Melina](https://www.twitch.tv/melina) is my wife. We met in New Zealand when she was 20 years old and I was 30 years old.

Melina and I are currently in an open/poly relationship. We treat each other as primary partners, though we may pursue other sexual/romantic relationships as well.
