## Why Philosophy is Important

In order to generate consistent policy positions that are efficacious, it is extremely important to have a philosophical foundation from which to draw practical conclusions. Political ideology is downstream from philosophy, and is arguably the practice of applied ethics on a societal level.

While I have no formal education in philosophy, I don't think this is a necessary prerequisite for participating in these discussions. Literally everyone engages with some form of this when advocating for political positions. Personally, through independent learning from resources such as the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html) and Wikipedia articles, I have constructed a philosophical heuristic to solve policy issues. Through understanding myriad fundamental belief structures/positions, I can more effectively understand my own and others' arguments, as well as create a consistent set of rules to abide by when evaluating various political issues.

My applied political positions always follow from my moral system: I think the world would be a better place if people reflected more on their internal, fundamental values and used those as guiding principles to establish their political values, rather than blindly following an ideologue, or inheriting doctrines from their parents, religion, country, or party.

In every conversation I have, I try to identify the fundamental disagreements I have with the opposing party. Generally, for any given topic, there is a either discrepancy regarding empirical facts, the proposed solution, or the impacts of the proposed way forward. Often times, it is more efficacious to drill down into what facts people believe to be true, or what goals they're trying to acomplish, in order to understand why they advocate for what they do. For example, the right to an [abortion](https://positions.destiny.gg/docs/politics#abortion) can be framed as a crucial inalienable reproductive right to some, while others view a fetus implanted in a uterus as a person worthy of moral consideration. Without any understanding of why the other side believes what tey do, no productive conversation can ever possibly occur.

## My Foundational Beliefs

I have a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-eTcjGsK08) where I give a comprehensive break down how I construct my philosophical worldview that I highly recommend. However, if you don't have the time to watch it, I will try to succinctly summarize my foundamental beliefs below:

- Part I
   1. I [exist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/#HowDoOurMinKno).
   2. I have an [experience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/).
   3. I want to [maximize](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egoism/#PsycEgoi) my experience.
- Part II
   1. Other humans [exist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/other-minds/).
   2. Other [humans](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/) have an experience like mine.
   3. Other humans want to [maximize](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/) their experience.
- Part III
   1. Humans [synergize](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219303343) to create better experiences.
   2. If I synergize with others, I can maximize my experience more than I could alone.
   3. If others synergize with me, they can maximize their experience more than they could alone.

Therefore, I think an optimal society should be constructed in a way that maximizes the experience of as many individuals as possible so as to incentivize everyone's participation in synergizing with other people and result in a higher maximization of everyone's experience than they could do on their own which means satisfying as many people's needs and desires as possible. There are many great systems to generate societal prescriptions, such as starting from [Rawls' veil of ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position), or optimizing [pareto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency). I [don't believe that moral facts exist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/), or if they do, we can't investigate them in any meaningful way. Therefore, this is the only way to construct a consistent moral framework that is applicable to everyone.

### On maximizing experiences

Many myopic interpretations of maximizing one's experience are often weaponized to attack my moral system. Many equate maximizing person experience with hedonism, and assert that it allows absolute freedom for anyone to do whatever they think makes them feel good whenever they want. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Consider the following: you are in a room with four friends and have five candy bars. You can either eat all of the candy bars yourself  because it would "maximize" your experience, or you could share the candy with your friends. The naive construction of my belief would entail the former. If we evaluate my friends' experience, they are likely now unhappy, might not want to be friends with me anymore, or might not share with me in the future. Realistically, [not sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism) the candy might result in better short-term results, but if we extend the timeline of analysis, that level of selfishness will likely result in them not wanting to be friends anymore, which will reduce my capacity for positive experiences in the future. This would certaintly NOT maximize my experience overall. My friends being sad would make me sad; them not being friends with me anymore would be upsetting, and it should be clear why this sort of behavior is disagreeable on the macro scale..

My frame of reference for maximizing an individual's experience is an intelligent, long-term, holistic view. If I start with 0 utils, and can choose between gaining 100 immediately or 25 every year for the rest of my life, choosing the former means after four years I will have lost out on benefits compared to choosing the latter. If I do something that makes me happy at the detriment of those around me, my experience at the end will likely produce a net negative result, so obviously I haven't made choices that maximize my experience.

## Violence

I am generally opposed to violence as a form of advocacy. It does not seem to be an effective way to accomplish political change, at least not at this point in time in the United States. While I do believe there are situations where violence can be morally justified, history has shown that this is not an incredibly effective modality for enacting political change.

### Defense of Property

I believe that people have a right to defend their property so long as three important criteria are met:
   1. You possess the property in a way that your state and community recognizes your possession,
   2. You have exhausted all reasonable non-violent options to protect your property, and 
   3. The other person is sufficiently made aware of their transgression and the potential consequences.

Most often, defense of personal property is reduced down to asking "is stuff more important than a human life?", which I find to be a disengenuous analysis. Anyone who has traded hours of their life in exchange for currency to purchase physical goods has already paid a significant price to acquire them, and it seems obvious they are entitled to a reasonable level of agency to maintain possession of objects they traded their time for.

In an extreme example, if someone relies on their small business to ensure the survival of themselves and/or their family, then they have a right to defend their property with all the fervor warranted if someone directly threatened the well being of persons reliant on the establishment. 

Many disagreements over whether or not defense of personal property is justified sometimes appear to boil down to a difference of underlying values. The value in question is whether "property can be valued over human life", or some statement to that effect. In my experience, middle-class and well-off people may underestimate the personal sacrifice and the years of time invested into obtaining a business, a car, or even something as simple as a stereo system or a school instrument. As such, they will argue that no matter the value and sacrifice associated with some property, even in the case of people living in poverty, the life of the thief always outweighs said value. This is a conclusion I take issue with.

### Protesting & Rioting

I ardently believe in a people's right to protest and I will always support the right to protest, even if I don't necessarily agree with positions being advocated for by any particular protest. For example, I would support the right of a pro-life group protesting the right to an abortion, but I wouldn't agree with the message of the pro-life group: that abortion is immoral, or should be outlawed.

Rioting is a slightly more complicated matter. When I speak about rioting, I am more precisely talking about protest that have some level of violence involved, namely that of property destruction. I do not support riots which seek to harm individuals in the United States at this point in time. I only support rioting against institutions that represent some oppressive force in society, so I *generally* only support rioting against public institutions, e.g. a police department, city hall, etc. It's not inconceivable that I would support a riot against a private institution, but only if that private institution was acting in an [illegal manner](https://youtu.be/Ikk9PxOn1F8?t=2244).

#### MLK & Riots

MLK is commonly cited as opposition to my position on riots, however, I believe this is due to misunderstanding selective quotes from MLK. I believe a broader understanding of his speeches reveals to us that he was opposed to violent riots throughout his life, even as he condemned the conditions bringing them about.

[September 1966 talk with Mike Wallace](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mlk-a-riot-is-the-language-of-the-unheard/#:~:text=In%20one%20of%20the%20most%20stirring%20refrains%20of%20his%20speech%2C%20Dr.&text=Three%20years%20later%20in%201966,civil%20rights%20movement%20were%20widening)
>KING (interview): **I will never change in my basic idea that non-violence is the most potent weapon available to the Negro in his struggle for freedom and justice.** I think **for the Negro to turn to violence would be both impractical and immoral.**
>
>MIKE WALLACE: There's an increasingly vocal minority who disagree totally with your tactics, Dr. King.
>
>KING: There's no doubt about that. I will agree that there is a group in the Negro community advocating violence now. I happen to feel that this group represents a numerical minority. Surveys have revealed this. The vast majority of Negroes still feel that the best way to deal with the dilemma that we face in this country is through non-violent resistance, and I don't think this vocal group will be able to make a real dent in the Negro community in terms of swaying 22 million Negroes to this particular point of view. And I contend that the cry of "black power" is, at bottom, a reaction to the reluctance of white power to make the kind of changes necessary to make justice a reality for the Negro. **I think that we've got to see that a riot is the language of the unheard.** And, what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the economic plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years.

[April 1967 speech to Stanford University.](https://www.crmvet.org/docs/otheram.htm)
>Let me say as I've always said, and **I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating. I'm still convinced that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom and justice. I feel that violence will only create more social problems than they will solve.** That in a real sense it is impracticable for the Negro to even think of mounting a violent revolution in the United States. So I will continue to condemn riots, and continue to say to my brothers and sisters that this is not the way. And continue to affirm that there is another way.
>
>But at the same time, **it is as necessary for me to be as vigorous in condemning the conditions which cause persons to feel that they must engage in riotous activities as it is for me to condemn riots.** I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years.

[1967 lecture "Nonviolence and Social Change"](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/04/martin-luther-king-jr-nonviolence-direct-action)
>Many people believe that the urban Negro is too angry and too sophisticated to be nonviolent. Those same people dismiss the nonviolent marches in the South and try to describe them as processions of pious, elderly ladies. The fact is that in all the marches we have organized some men of very violent tendencies have been involved. **It was routine for us to collect hundreds of knives from our own ranks before the demonstrations, in case of momentary weakness.** And in Chicago last year we saw some of the most violent individuals accepting nonviolent discipline. Day after day during those Chicago marches I walked in our lines and I never saw anyone retaliate with violence. There were lots of provocations, not only the screaming white hoodlums lining the sidewalks, but also groups of Negro militants talking about guerrilla warfare. We had some gang leaders and members marching with us. I remember walking with the Blackstone Rangers while bottles were flying from the sidelines, and I saw their noses being broken and blood flowing from their wounds; and I saw them continue and not retaliate, not one of them, with violence. **I am convinced that even very violent temperaments can be channeled through nonviolent discipline, if the movement is moving, if they can act constructively and express through an effective channel their very legitimate anger.**

[March 1968 speech at Grosse Pointe High School, "The Other America"](https://www.gphistorical.org/mlk/mlkspeech/mlk-gp-speech.pdf)
>Now I wanted to say something about the fact that we have lived over these last two or three summers with agony and we have seen our cities going up in flames. And I would be the first to say that **I am still committed to militant, powerful, massive, non-violence as the most potent weapon in grappling with the problem from a direct action point of view. I'm absolutely convinced that a riot merely intensifies the fears of the white community while relieving the guilt. And I feel that we must always work with an effective, powerful weapon and method that brings about tangible results.** But it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.

## Public vs Private Humor

I enjoy all types of comedy, even if it's dark or offensive. Regardless of how I feel, there is a wide chasm between the types of humor that I enjoy privately and the types of humor I believe are responsibly enjoyed publicly. I believe that public figures have to be more careful when engaging with potentially problematic types of humor because one cannot control the audience that may engage with particular types of humor. As public figures, we should avoid empowering groups of people who have ideologies rooted in values contradicting our own, even in speech/actions where we do not intend to do so but it still has that effect.

An example of a type of "edgy joke" might be the way I engage with a close friend relating to gender/sexuality/race. It might be an "inside joke" in private where my friend and I have cleared with each other that it's okay to joke about certain topics (e.g., my friend joking about me being Cuban, me joking about them being black, etc.). If we were to engage in these types of humor publicly without a large number of disclaimers, it's entirely possible that people could take these jokes the wrong way and engage with them problematically, e.g. "I heard Destiny make fun of xyz for being gay, now I'm going to make fun of other gay people because it was funny!"

Because of certain people obsessively trying to get "optics victories" over me, this entire argument becomes reframed by them as "Destiny wants to say the n-word in private." I don't regularly use any hateful language in private, especially because I just don't know many jokes involving hateful language. However, that's not to say that that there aren't [any examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdY89tENgmM) of such jokes.

## Incest

"Incest" as a topic has been explored quite extensively on my stream as a way to illustrate the concept of ["moral dumbfounding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_intuitionism), i.e. you have a feeling that something is immoral or "wrong," but find you're unable to explain exactly why you feel that way. It seems hard, when pressed, to explain exactly why an incestuous relationship is wrong without appealing to other arguments that aren't intrinsic to these kinds of relationships. For example: parent/child (these are wrong due to power differences or underage parties, not necessarily the fact that they are incestuous), or situations involving reproduction (these may be "wrong" due to the potential for offspring with increased risk of birth defects being created, though this could have logical implications for other kinds of eugenics).

I've used this topic several times on stream to see if someone is capable of actually engaging with the topic, though it generally devolves into people screaming at me while claiming I want ["fathers fucking daughters"](https://youtu.be/jRPb1t_dBlI?t=9628) or something [similarly absurd](https://youtu.be/-KfdsuYUKW8?t=2149). It is a useful measure of someone's ability to engage with arguments in good faith, question their own worldview, and engage with the logic of ethical matters. While I usually frame the argument from a position of moral neutrality, [I have previously made clear](https://youtu.be/egoyHzHn8Xk?t=1370) that I am not in favour of incestual relationships and provided what I believe to be logical arguments for this.

## Child Pornography

I do not support child pornography and I ardently [argue against](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uw9NWF7Z6w) all forms of adult-child sexual relationships (pedophilia).

During a longer discussion I had arguing in favor of age-of-consent laws with Amos Yee, there is a small section where [Amos Yee questioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uw9NWF7Z6w&t=5040s) whether child pornography could ever be used in a positive manner. I'd been made familiar with some research indicating it was possible that this could be the case ( [1](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8341.1995.tb01810.x) | [2](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-9-43) | [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:ASEB.0000029071.89455.53) | [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9696-y) | [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160252798000351?via%3Dihub) | [6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01540933?LI=true) | [7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178909000445) ), though there would obviously be significant hurdles doing this in an ethical manner. It would be essential to ensure that no new pornography abusing minors would be created and that anything being used as part of any therapy was obtained in an ethical manner, though it's hard to imagine how this would even be possible.

In entertaining this scenario, many who argue against me online are quick to claim that I "advocate for ethical child pornography" or some other reductive statement, though none of these claims are true.
